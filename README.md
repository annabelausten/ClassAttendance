This repository contains the **ClassAttendance** prototype — a mobile app built using **React Native** and **Expo**.  
The project includes two primary screens:

- **Home Page**: A sign-in interface with email and password inputs, a "Sign In" button, and a link to create a new account.  
- **Styles Page**: A visual style guide showing colors, icons, and typography used throughout the app.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate front-end mobile design principles and consistent UI styling through React Native and Expo’s development environment.
